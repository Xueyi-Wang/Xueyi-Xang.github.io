title: Healthy Living as a Service
summary:  We use smart sensors, such as in "smart watches," sensors dei can measure sleep and stress, to measure the health and living environment of participating citizens. Through dialogue with citizens, we learn what different users want and how they interact with the technology. The information is combined in a toolbox with artificial intelligence to coach citizens, support them in making healthy choices and motivate them to stick with it.
